# javascript

Developped by Brendan Eich in December 4, 1995, for Netscape initially. It has successfully and
rapidly grows.

Today two context exist to do javascript: in a browser and in an interpreter.
The context in a browser is limited and you are not totally free.
We will do a little introduction to React to show what is a SPA, and how manipulation of the DOM
work.
And we will work on a little server that will interact with apis.

# Browser JS

See browser.md


# ServerSide/Application Side

Alot of interpreter and implementation has been made (coffescript, nodejs, typescript, livescript...)
The syntax changes but behind it is always javascript that run so there is not a lot of new concepts.

## Nodejs

### Package manager

I would strongly advice to use `yarn` to manage your dependencies.

## Typescript
